      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Roadmap for GOV.UK PaaS</h1>
      <p>We want to build GOV.UK PaaS to be useful for service teams across government. This roadmap is a rough indication of what we’re planning to build in the near, medium and long-term based on what users have told us they need.</p>

      <p>If you would like to find out more about these plans, or you have feedback on whether or not these features are useful for you, please <a href="/support.html">get in touch</a>. We are also keen for private beta partners on forthcoming features.</p>

      <p>You can also see <a href="/features.html">what GOV.UK PaaS offers right now</a>, or walk through a full <a href="/onboarding.html">onboarding and development journey</a>.</p>

	</ul>

<p>* = dependent on upstream developments by Cloud Foundry Foundation</p>

	 <h2 class="heading-large">Experimental features</h2>

	 <p>The following features have been introduced as an Alpha, to get user feedback and gain insight into stability. We would not recommend that any services in live operation adopt these features as they may be revoked should there be significant issues. Wherever possible, we will provide four weeks notice to tenants if an Alpha feature is to be discontinued.</p>

	 <h3 class="heading-medium">Docker support for public images</h3>

	 <p>Cloud Foundry supports pushing a public Docker image as an application. This is currently enabled as an experimental feature, to enable the platform and our tenants to explore it further. Please note that the usual 12-factor principles apply, and Docker images should not be used for persistent storage.

	 <p>We hope to expand our support for Docker images in the future. If you would like to discuss your needs in this area, please <a href="/support.html">contact our support team</a>, and let us know why.</p>

   <h2 class="heading-large">Requested features</h2>

	 <p>Below are the features we’ve been asked about but are not planning to develop right now, and why.</p>

	 <h3 class="heading-medium">Multi-cloud</h3>

	 <p>This has not been a substantial need for many tenants to date. However we are monitoring the market and keen to see how this space develops.</p>

   <h3 class="heading-medium">Anti-virus scanning on uploads</h3>

	 <p>This is currently only a need for one tenant with low traffic, and an alternative solution has been found. Should more services have this need we may reprioritise.</p>
