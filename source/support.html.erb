      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">How GOV.UK PaaS is supported</h1>

      <p>
        GOV.UK PaaS is supported 24 hours a day, seven days a week by the team that builds it. Response times and resolutions vary depending on the service status.
      </p>

      <p>You can view the availability and database connectivity of live applications on GOV.UK PaaS on our <a href="https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/">system status page</a>. If you have a critical issue, start by checking this page: if it’s an issue with GOV.UK PaaS we’re already working on it, and we’ll keep our users updated on the progression of the incident.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Support during working hours</h2>

        <p>Our office hours are 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday. If GOV.UK PaaS shows as working, and you're experiencing a critical issue,you can email us at <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>. You can also use this email to get help using the PaaS.</p>

        <p>We prioritise fixing issues with the platform over answering user queries, and support for live services over support for services in development. For more information on how we respond to requests, you can look at our <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#technical-documentation-for-gov-uk-paas">technical documentation</a>.</p>




      <h2 class="heading-large">Support outside of working hours</h2>

      <p>
        Between 5pm and 9am on Monday to Friday, at weekends and during Bank Holidays we provide emergency support for critical incidents affecting live production services.
        A critical incident is where:
      </p>
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>
              your application is unavailable due to a problem with our platform
            </li>
            <li>
              you can’t make a critical upgrade to your application because the GOV.UK PaaS API isn’t available
            </li>
            <li>
              you are experiencing a critical issue with your application that you cannot resolve without help from the platform team.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <p>
        We’ll start working on the issue within 40 minutes and email you to let you know. We’ll address anything that is not a critical incident the next working day.
      </p>

      <p>If GOV.UK PaaS shows as working and you have a critical issue outside of working hours, please use the emergency email address you have been given. This will raise a high priority ticket which could alert us during the night, so it should only be used for critical P1 incidents. Please do not share this email address with people outside of your team.</p>
